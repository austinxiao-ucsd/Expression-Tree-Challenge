# Expression-Tree-Challenge
My submission for the Twitter Coding Challenge.
For the first question, I am being asked to implement an algorithm
that evaluates an expression tree. The valid inputs are 'R' and 'S'.
# Approach
I break down the string and constructed the tree using a stack.
And then I traverse and compress it to get the correct output.
# Notice
Since Twitter did not ask me to sign an NDA, I posted my code here.
If you are taking the same challenge, you may not use any part of
this code for your solution. This is provided as a reference and I
would be very happy to hear about your solution/approach.
